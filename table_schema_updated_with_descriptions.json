Objective of SOH dashboard is to highlight Premium and Niche skills with potential to increase rates from market standpoint and upsell those which are commanding high rates and hence improve margin. This Dashboard caters to Service Offering Heads, Deliver Heads and Delivery Managers. Underlying cube utilizes Org staffing report from DPS system as base data. On top of columns in org staffing report, it calculates Variance to Rack Rate which is a function of difference between TCV at Sold Rate and TCV at Rack Rate. For a comprehensive coverage Variance and TCV for Premium and Niche skills is highlighted at various categories such as DH portfolio, Segment, Skill, Account. Data is refreshed on monthly basis and review period is updated for latest 3 months comparing with the previous quarter.",

The WorkFromOfficeCount column captures the count of employees who worked from the office in a given month, also stored as an Int64, allowing for large integer values. The Year column indicates the calendar year associated with each record, represented as an integer (e.g., 2021, 2022).

The table has several columns, each representing different aspects of the travel request. The Approvalstatus column, which is a variable character type, likely indicates the status of the travel request approval, such as pending, approved, or denied. The ApproverorderApproverNoApprovermailid column seems to contain the email ID of the person who approves the travel requests. This is also a variable character type, suggesting it can contain alphanumeric characters. The FromLocation and ToLocation columns, both variable character types, likely represent the starting location and the destination of the proposed travel, respectively. The Purpose column probably contains the reason for the travel request. The Requesteddate and TravelDate columns, both datetime types, likely represent the date when the travel request was made and the proposed date of travel, respectively. The Requeststatus column likely indicates the current status of the travel request, such as pending, approved, or denied. Finally, the TravelReqNo column, an integer type, likely represents a unique identifier or number assigned to each travel request for tracking purposes.",

It enables comprehensive tracking and management of project codes, customer associations, organizational units, and delivery structures. The table supports governance and operational oversight by capturing key identifiers like project codes (ProjectCode), customer accounts (CustomerCode), and their hierarchical relationships through fields such as LinkedTo, MasterProjectCode, and IsLinked. It also includes organizational classifications like Unit, PracticeUnit, DeliveryUnit, and SubUnit, which help in segmenting and analyzing data across business units. Managerial accountability is embedded through login identifiers of various stakeholders including Project Managers, Delivery Managers, Senior Delivery Managers, Group Project Managers, and Senior Project Managers. Quality governance is facilitated by capturing the login details of Account Quality Managers, Practice Quality Managers, and Quality Anchors. The table tracks project lifecycle attributes such as EndDate, PROPELEndDate, and ProjectAgeing, which are essential for understanding project timelines and aging. Operational metrics like PROPELFTE and PROPELTeamSize provide insights into resource allocation and team composition. Risk management is supported through the RiskStatus column, which categorizes projects based on their exposure levels. The table also includes fields like ManagedBy, Status, and ProjectStatus to distinguish between Infosys-managed and customer-managed projects, and to reflect their current operational state. Technology and tooling information is captured through columns like tools, technology, Service, and ServiceOfferings, which help in identifying the technical stack and service applicability for each project. Derived measures such as Percentage of Customer managed projects and Total MI codes offer strategic insights into project ownership and distribution. This table is refreshed periodically and serves as a critical data source for dashboards and analytics used by Delivery Managers, Practice Heads, and Quality Anchors.",

The MaxRatingScale column indicates the maximum rating scale applicable to the form type, typically either a 5-point or 7-point scale. The ELFReceivedDate column logs the date on which feedback was received, helping track submission timelines. The Next due by column calculates the upcoming due date for feedback based on the defined frequency, ensuring timely follow-ups.

It captures the current rating of a project through the Rating column, which includes values such as Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Plastic, and Not Rated. These ratings reflect the maturity and compliance level of a project based on internal assessment criteria. The NextAssessmentDueDate column indicates the scheduled date for the next BEST assessment, while the LastBESTAssessedDate column records the most recent date on which the project was assessed. The OpenFindings column provides the count of unresolved findings or action items identified during the assessment, highlighting areas that require attention. The AssessmentOverDue column measures the time elapsed since the last assessment, helping to identify overdue evaluations. The Due for BEST Rating column flags whether a project is due for reassessment, based on the condition that the next assessment due date is more than 45 days from the last assessment date. In addition to these columns, the table includes several measures that support performance tracking and strategic analysis. The Gold plus percentage measure calculates the proportion of Infosys-managed projects with a PROPELFTE greater than 4 that have received a Gold, Platinum, or Diamond rating. The Projects in GOLD measure provides the total count of projects rated as Gold, while the Projects in Not Rated measure counts those without a formal rating. The Projects in Gold+ measure aggregates the count of projects rated as Gold, Platinum, or Diamond, offering a consolidated view of high-performing projects.",
